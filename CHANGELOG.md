* Fixes an issue with `britive.reports.run()` pagination. The last page of results is now included.
* Fixes an issue with `britive.reports.run()` results being truncated to a maximum of 1000 records when `csv=False`. This was due to how the API handles JSON results vs. CSV results. Now the results are always obtained in CSV format from the API and then converted to a list of dictionaries if `csv=False`.
